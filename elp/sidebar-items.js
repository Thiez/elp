Unfortunately it must be made public in order to implement the Index trait. I could use the newtype pattern but the newtype pattern forces another level of indirection with no gain besides reducing the exposure a little. I hope that in the future we'll be able to implement public methods without having to expose, what should be, private details. Update 02/14/2016: This behaviour has been changed in 1.7.0 nightly.
